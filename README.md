# Bumblebee Switch
Simple bash script to change the power state of a Nvidia Card controlled by [Bumblebee](https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee).
It can be useful when you're trying to use [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) but your graphic card is being controlled by bbswitch.
